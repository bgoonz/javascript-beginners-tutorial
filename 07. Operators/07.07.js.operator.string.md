7.  # Operators

\- We know/use many operators since our initial school days, they are things like addition +, multiplication \*, subtraction -, open close round bracket ( ) or square bracket \[ \]

- Operators are symbols/keywords that tell the JavaScript engine to \`perform some sort of actions\`
- JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands
- Operators used along with our variables and constants to create expressions to implement logic and algorithms

## JavaScript supports the following types of operators:

1.  Arithmetic Operators
2.  Assignment Operators
3.  Logical Operators
4.  Comparison (or Relational) Operators
5.  Conditional (or ternary) Operators
6.  Bitwise Operators
7.  Special Operators
8.  String Operators

## 07.07. String Operators

Variables can also have string values, \`+ operator\` can be used to concatenate strings as well as numbers.

There are two operators which can also used be for strings:

| Operators | Description | Example / Result |  
| **+ | Concatenation** | string1 + string2 (Concatenation of string1 and string2) |  
| **+= | Concatenation assignment** | string1 += string2 (Appends the str2 to the str1) |
