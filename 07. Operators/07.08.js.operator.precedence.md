7.  # Operators

\- We know/use many operators since our initial school days, they are things like addition +, multiplication \*, subtraction -, open close round bracket ( ) or square bracket \[ \]

- Operators are symbols/keywords that tell the JavaScript engine to \`perform some sort of actions\`
- JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands
- Operators used along with our variables and constants to create expressions to implement logic and algorithms

## JavaScript supports the following types of operators:

1.  Arithmetic Operators
2.  Assignment Operators
3.  Logical Operators
4.  Comparison (or Relational) Operators
5.  Conditional (or ternary) Operators
6.  Bitwise Operators
7.  Special Operators
8.  String Operators

## 07.08. Operator precedence

- If an expression has more than one operator, the \`execution order is defined by their precedence\`, or the implicit priority order of operators
- Operator precedence determines/describes the way in which operators are parsed with respect to each other / \`order in which operations are performed\`
- The operations inside the \`parentheses ()\` are computed first
- If many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction), they are \`computed from left to right\`
