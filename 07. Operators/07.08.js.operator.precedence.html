        <p class="para-text" id="mainParaText">
            - We know/use many operators since our initial school days, they are things like addition +, multiplication *, subtraction -, open close round bracket ( ) or square bracket [ ]<br/>
            - Operators are symbols/keywords that tell the JavaScript engine to `perform some sort of actions`<br/>
            - JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands<br/>
            - Operators used along with our variables and constants to create
            expressions to implement logic and algorithms<br/></p>

        <h2>JavaScript supports the following types of operators:</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
          <li>Assignment Operators</li>
          <li>Logical Operators</li>
          <li>Comparison (or Relational) Operators</li>
          <li>Conditional (or ternary) Operators</li>
          <li>Bitwise Operators</li>
          <li>Special Operators</li>
          <li>String Operators</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>07.08. Operator precedence</h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>If an expression has more than one operator, the `execution order is defined by their precedence`, or the implicit priority order of operators</li>
          <li>Operator precedence determines/describes the way in which operators are parsed with respect to each other / `order in which operations are performed`</li>
          <li>The operations inside the `parentheses ()` are computed first</li>
          <li>If many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction), they are `computed from left to right`</li>
        </ul>
