9.  # Loops

1.  Loops are used to execute the \`same block of code again, with a different value, until a certain condition is met\`
1.  Loops can execute a block of code a number of times
1.  The basic idea behind a loop is to \`automate the repetitive tasks within a program to save the time and effort\`
1.  It makes the \`code compact\`
1.  It is mostly used in array or object (to iterate through series)

## Different Types of Loops in JavaScript:

1.  for Loop
2.  while Loop
3.  do...while Loop
4.  for...in Loop
5.  for...of Loop (ES6)

## 09.05. The for...of Loop (ES6)

- Loops over \`iterable objects such as arrays, strings\`, etc.
- ES6 introduces a new for-of loop which allows us to iterate over arrays or strings very easily
- The code inside the loop is executed for each element of the iterable object

## The for...of Loop (ES6) output
