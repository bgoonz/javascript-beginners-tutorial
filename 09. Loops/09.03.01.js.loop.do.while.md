09. Loops
=========

1.  Loops are used to execute the \`same block of code again, with a different value, until a certain condition is met\`
2.  Loops can execute a block of code a number of times
3.  The basic idea behind a loop is to \`automate the repetitive tasks within a program to save the time and effort\`
4.  It makes the \`code compact\`
5.  It is mostly used in array or object (to iterate through series)

Different Types of Loops in JavaScript:
---------------------------------------

1.  for Loop
2.  while Loop
3.  do...while Loop
4.  for...in Loop
5.  for...of Loop (ES6)

09.03. The do...while Loop
--------------------------

-   The do...while loop is similar to the while loop except that the \`condition check happens at the end of the loop\`
-   The do...while loop will always be \`executed at least once (before checking if the condition is true)\`, even if the condition is false

The do...while Loop output
--------------------------
