9.  # Loops

1.  Loops are used to execute the \`same block of code again, with a different value, until a certain condition is met\`
1.  Loops can execute a block of code a number of times
1.  The basic idea behind a loop is to \`automate the repetitive tasks within a program to save the time and effort\`
1.  It makes the \`code compact\`
1.  It is mostly used in array or object (to iterate through series)

## Different Types of Loops in JavaScript:

1.  for Loop
2.  while Loop
3.  do...while Loop
4.  for...in Loop
5.  for...of Loop (ES6)

## 09.06. Break and Continue statement

- \`break\` and \`continue\` keywords/statement can change \`how the loop behaves\`
- \`break\` and \`continue\` keywords can be used in all loops to stop or continue the loop
- The \`break\` statement is used to exit a loop early, to "jump out" of a loop, stops executing/running a loop
- The \`continue\` statement tells the interpreter to immediately start the next iteration of the loop and skip the remaining code block
