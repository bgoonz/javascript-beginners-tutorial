4.  # Generating Output

- JavaScript does not have any \`display or built-in print\` functions
- Many times we may need to generate output from your JavaScript code like \`see the value of variable\`, or \`write a message to browser console\` to help you \`debug an issue\` in your running JavaScript code, and so on
- That is why you have to use the JavaScript output function to generating output \`(browser window or browser console dialog boxes, writing output into an HTML element, etc.)\`
- Using different output methods knowledge will help you while debugging or rewriting your code more conveniently

## Different ways to show output/display data

1.  Writing into an alert box with \`alert() or window.alert()\`
2.  Writing into browser console with \`console.log()\`
3.  Writing into the HTML / Browser Window with \`document.write()\`
4.  Write into an element of HTML / Inserting Output Inside an HTML Element with \`innerHTML\`

## 04.01.04. Inserting Output Inside an HTML Element: innerHTML

- We can write or insert output inside an HTML element using the element's \`innerHTML\` property
- First we need to select the element using a method such as \`document.getElementById(id)\`
- Note: HTML element manipulating is fully dependent on JavaScript DOM manipulation concepts
