        <p class="para-text" id="mainParaText">Variables are one of the most fundamental concepts in JavaScript and other all programming languages.</p>

        <h2>05.01. Variable</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Variable is `container to store/hold the data/information`</li>
          <li>Variable is kind of data holder where we can store some value for programming or calculation purpose</li>
          <li>A JavaScript variable is simply a `name of storage location (named containers/named storage)` for data</li>
          <li>The `assignment operator (=)` is used to assign value to a variable, like this: `var varName = value;` or `var firstName = 'JavaScript';`</li>
          <li>Example: Variable declaration and assignment is just `like Maths & Algebra`: `x = 10`; and in JavaScript we write `var x = 10;`</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>05.06. The let and const Keywords ES6</h2>

        <p>ES6 introduces two new keywords `let` and `const` for declaring variables. The `var, let and const` keywords are almost same, just few differences with scope. In older programms `var` is used a lot which declares a variable `(function-scoped variables)`, but in a slightly different `old` way, with scope issues. Both `let` and `const` keywords declare variables, `scoped at block-level ({})`. Block scoping means that a new scope is created `between a pair of curly brackets {}`.</p>

        <h2>The let Keyword</h2>
        
        <ul class="normalList">
          <li>`ES6` introduces the new `let` keyword for declaring variables. Prior to ES6, the only way to declare a variable in JavaScript was the var keyword. Let's see what's the difference:</li>
          <li>Variables declared with the `var` keyword are `function-scoped` and can be `hoisted` at the top within its scope</li>
          <li>Variables declared with `let` keyword are `block-scoped ({})` and they are not hoisted</li>
        </ul>
