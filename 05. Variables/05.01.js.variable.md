Variables are one of the most fundamental concepts in JavaScript and other all programming languages.

## 05.01. Variable

- Variable is \`container to store/hold the data/information\`
- Variable is kind of data holder where we can store some value for programming or calculation purpose
- A JavaScript variable is simply a \`name of storage location (named containers/named storage)\` for data
- The \`assignment operator (=)\` is used to assign value to a variable, like this: \`var varName = value;\` or \`var firstName = 'JavaScript';\`
- Example: Variable declaration and assignment is just \`like Maths & Algebra\`: \`x = 10\`; and in JavaScript we write \`var x = 10;\`
