11. # Array

1.  An Array is special type of variable/object which \`consists of / stores multiple values\`
1.  Arrays are complex variables that allow us to store more than one value or a group of values under a single variable name
1.  Arrays are defined with \`square brackets \[ \]\` and with \`new\` keyword
1.  Array items are normally separated with \`commas ,\`
1.  Arrays are zero-indexed i.e. the first element of an array is at index/position 0
1.  Array is ordered collection, where we have a 0th, 1st, a 2nd, and so on elements
1.  Each value (an \`element\`) in an array has a \`numeric position\`, known as its \`index\`, \`starts from 0\`, so that the first array element is arr\[0\] not arr\[1\]

## Different ways to create/define an Array:

1.  By array literal
2.  By creating instance of Array directly (using new keyword)
3.  By using an Array constructor (using new keyword)

## 11.06. Accessing/Looping through an Array Elements

- Array elements can be accessed by their \`index using the square bracket notation ie. \[index\]\`
- Arrays are \`zero-indexed\` i.e. the first element of an array is at index/position 0
- An array is \`ordered collection\`, where we have a 0th, 1st, a 2nd, and so on elements
- Each value (an \`element\`) in an array has a \`numeric position\`, known as its \`index\`, \`starts from 0\`, so that the first array element is \`arr\[0\]\` not arr\[1\]
- One can use \`for loop\` in co-ordination with array \`length\` property to access each element of an array in sequential order
- myarray\[indexNumber\], myarray\[0\] // get first array element

## Example Output: Loop through an Array Elements - Different JavaScript Frameworks
