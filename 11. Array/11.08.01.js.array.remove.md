11. Array
=========

1.  An Array is special type of variable/object which \`consists of / stores multiple values\`
2.  Arrays are complex variables that allow us to store more than one value or a group of values under a single variable name
3.  Arrays are defined with \`square brackets \[ \]\` and with \`new\` keyword
4.  Array items are normally separated with \`commas ,\`
5.  Arrays are zero-indexed i.e. the first element of an array is at index/position 0
6.  Array is ordered collection, where we have a 0th, 1st, a 2nd, and so on elements
7.  Each value (an \`element\`) in an array has a \`numeric position\`, known as its \`index\`, \`starts from 0\`, so that the first array element is arr\[0\] not arr\[1\]

Different ways to create/define an Array:
-----------------------------------------

1.  By array literal
2.  By creating instance of Array directly (using new keyword)
3.  By using an Array constructor (using new keyword)

11.08. Removing an Array Elements
---------------------------------

-   \`pop()\` method \`remove the last element\` from an array
-   \`shift()\` method remove the \`first element\` from an array
-   myarray.pop(), myarray.shift()
