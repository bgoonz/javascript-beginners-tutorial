3. # Where to embedd/include/write/put JavaScript in HTML?

JavaScript provides 3 places to write the JavaScript code in our webpage:

1.  Inside the HEAD section
2.  Inside the BODY section
3.  External JavaScript .js file (separation of concern)

## 03.02.03. External JavaScript .js file (separation of concern)

- We can easily write JavaScript code in between the \`script element\`. In a real world application, we have 100+ maybe even a 1000+ lines of code, we don't want to write all that code in line here
- We must have to \`extract and separate\` our JavaScript behavior code from our html markup code
- A simple thumb-rule is if we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file - We can use/add/attach an external JavaScript file by using \`script\` tag with \`src (source)\` attribute:
  - script src="path/scriptfile.js" /script\`\`\`
  - One can provide a \`full URL (absolute path)\` or \`relative path\` from current page
- We can create single external JavaScript file and embed it in many html page which provides \`code re-usability\`
