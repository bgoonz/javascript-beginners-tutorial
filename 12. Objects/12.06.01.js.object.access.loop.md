12. # Objects

## 12.01. Real Life Object, Properties and Method examples

In real life almost \`everything is an object\`. For example: Human, Car, Building, Bike, Pen, Chair, Monitor, Keyboard, Vehicle, Mobile, Computer etc.

## 12.02. Objects

- JavaScript is an \`object-based language\` and in JavaScript almost everything is an object or acts like an object
- Object is a \`special/complex\` data type that allows you to \`store collections of data\`
- Object is kind of container/declaration where we can group various \`data, properties, and behaviors\` under one roof
- A JavaScript object is just a collection of \`named values referred as properties\` of the object
- Objects are defined with \`curly braces { }\`, the properties of an object are written in pairs (\`propertyName: value\`)
- An object contains properties, defined as a \`key-value pair\`
- A property \`key (name) is always a string\`, but the value which it stores can be any data types, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects
- JavaScript object properties can be accessed through two methods: \`1. object.firstName 2. object\['firstName'\]\`

## Different ways to create/define an Object:

1.  By object literal
2.  By creating an instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
3.  By using an Object constructor (using new keyword)

## 12.06. Accessing/Looping through Object's Properties

- To access or get the value of a property, you can use the \`dot .\`, or \`square bracket \[\]\` notation
- We can iterate through the \`key-value pairs\` of an object using the \`for...in loop\`
- MyObject.propertyName; OR MyObject\[propertyName\]; OR MyObject\['propertyName'\]
