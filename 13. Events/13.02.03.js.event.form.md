## 13.01. Understanding Events and Event Handlers

Events are happening/triggering all over, Event lets the developer know \`something has occurred/happened\`

Events occur when the page loads (Onload), when user interact with the web page (clicked a link or button / hover) (onlick), pressed key, moved the mouse pointer, mouse-clicked/hover (onmouseover), entered text into an input box or textarea (onchange,onblur, onfocus), submits a form (submit), page unloads (unload)

When an event occur, use a JavaScript \`event handler (or an event listener) to detect\` them and perform specific task - Event handlers name always begin with the word \`"on"\`, like onclick, onload, onblur, and so on.

To react to an event you \`listen\` for it and supply a \`callback function or event handler\` which will be called by the browser when the event occurs

## 13.02.03. Form events

A form event is triggered when a form control/form fields (text fields/radio buttons/checkbox) receives or loses focus or when the user modify a form control value by typing text in a text input, select any option in a dropdown/select box etc. Lets look into some of most important form events and their event handler:

1.  **focus** (\`onfocus\` event handler)  
    Occurs when the user focuses on an element on a web page, e.g. on an \`input\` text field
2.  **blur** (\`onblur\` event handler)  
    Occurs when the user takes the focus away from a form element or a window
3.  **change** (\`onchange\` event handler)  
    Occurs when the user changes the value of a form element/fields
4.  **submit** (\`onsubmit\` event handler)  
    Occurs only when the user submits a form on a web page
