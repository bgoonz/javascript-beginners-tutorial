7.  # Operators

\- We know/use many operators since our initial school days, they are things like addition +, multiplication \*, subtraction -, open close round bracket ( ) or square bracket \[ \]

- Operators are symbols/keywords that tell the JavaScript engine to \`perform some sort of actions\`
- JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands
- Operators used along with our variables and constants to create expressions to implement logic and algorithms

## JavaScript supports the following types of operators:

1.  Arithmetic Operators
2.  Assignment Operators
3.  Logical Operators
4.  Comparison (or Relational) Operators
5.  Conditional (or ternary) Operators
6.  Bitwise Operators
7.  Special Operators
8.  String Operators

## 07.03. Assignment Operators

The Assignment operators are used to assign particular values to variables. JavaScript supports the following Assignment operators (List of Assignment operators):

| Operators | Description | Example / Result |  
| **= | Simple Assignment** | 10 + 20 = 30; / var total = num1 + num2; (assigns a value to the variable) |  
| **+= | Add and assign** | var num1 = 10; num1 += 20; Now num1 = 30 (assigns and adds value to the variable, num1 += 20; is equivalent to num1 = num1 + 20;)|  
| **-= | Subtract and assign** | var num1 = 10; num1 -= 5; Now num1 = 5 (assigns and subtract value to the variable, num1 -= 5; is equivalent to num1 = num1 - 5;)|  
| **\*= | Multiply and assign** | var num1 = 10; num1 \*= 5; Now num1 = 50 (assigns and multiply value to variable, num1 \*= 5; is equivalent to num1 = num1 \* 5;)|  
| **/= | Divide and assign** | var num1 = 10; num1 /= 5; Now num1 = 2 (assigns and divide value to the variable, num1 /= 5; is equivalent to num1 = num1 / 5;)|  
| **%= | Modulus and assign** | var num1 = 10; num1 %= 5; Now num1 = 0 (assigns and Modulus value to the variable, num1 %= 5; is equivalent to num1 = num1 % 5;)|
