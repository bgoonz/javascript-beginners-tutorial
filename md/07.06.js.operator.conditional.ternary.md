7.  # Operators

\- We know/use many operators since our initial school days, they are things like addition +, multiplication \*, subtraction -, open close round bracket ( ) or square bracket \[ \]

- Operators are symbols/keywords that tell the JavaScript engine to \`perform some sort of actions\`
- JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands
- Operators used along with our variables and constants to create expressions to implement logic and algorithms

## JavaScript supports the following types of operators:

1.  Arithmetic Operators
2.  Assignment Operators
3.  Logical Operators
4.  Comparison (or Relational) Operators
5.  Conditional (or ternary) Operators
6.  Bitwise Operators
7.  Special Operators
8.  String Operators

## 07.06. Conditional (? or ternary) Operator

- Conditional Operator returns value based on the condition, it is like if-else
- The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands
- Conditional operator that assigns a value to a variable based on some condition
- This operator is frequently used as a shortcut/short-hand method for the if statement

| Operators | Description | Example / Result |  
| **? | Ternary operator** | var result = x &lt; y ? 'x is smaller' : 'y is smaller' (short hand method to write if condition)|
