3. # Where to embedd/include/write/put JavaScript in HTML?

JavaScript provides 3 places to write the JavaScript code in our webpage:

1.  Inside the HEAD section
2.  Inside the BODY section
3.  External JavaScript .js file (separation of concern)

## 03.02.01. Inside the HEAD section (code between the head tag)

- JavaScript programs/code/statements can be placed in the \`head\` section of an HTML page
- As each \`script...../script\` tag blocks the page rendering process until it has fully downloaded and executed the JavaScript code so placing them in the \`head section (head element\` of the document without any valid reason will significantly impact your website performance
