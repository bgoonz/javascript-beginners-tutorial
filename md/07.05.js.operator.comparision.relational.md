7.  # Operators

\- We know/use many operators since our initial school days, they are things like addition +, multiplication \*, subtraction -, open close round bracket ( ) or square bracket \[ \]

- Operators are symbols/keywords that tell the JavaScript engine to \`perform some sort of actions\`
- JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands
- Operators used along with our variables and constants to create expressions to implement logic and algorithms

## JavaScript supports the following types of operators:

1.  Arithmetic Operators
2.  Assignment Operators
3.  Logical Operators
4.  Comparison (or Relational) Operators
5.  Conditional (or ternary) Operators
6.  Bitwise Operators
7.  Special Operators
8.  String Operators

## 07.05. Comparison (or Relational) Operators

- The JavaScript comparison operator compares the two operands
- It compare two values in a Boolean fashion
- The comparison operators are used to determine the similarity and difference between different variables

JavaScript supports the following Comparison (or Relational) operators (List of Comparison (or Relational) operators):

| Operators | Description | Example / Result |  
| **== | Is equal to / identical** | x == y (True if x is equal to y) |  
| **=== | Eqaul/identical value and identical type** | x === y (True if x is equal to y, and they are of the same type) |  
| **!= | Not equal to / different** | x != y (True if x is not equal to y) |  
| **!== | Not identical / different value or different type** | x !== y )True if x is not equal to y, or they are not of the same type) |  
| **&lt; | Less than** | x &lt; y (True if x is less than y)|  
| **&gt; | Greater than** | x &gt; y (True if x is greater than y)|  
| **&lt;= | Less than or equal to** | x &lt;= y (True if x is less than or equal to y) |  
| **&gt;= | Greater than or equal to** | x &gt;= y (True if x is greater than or equal to y)|
