3.  # Where to embedd/include/write/put JavaScript in HTML?

JavaScript provides 3 places to write the JavaScript code in our webpage:

1.  Inside the HEAD section
2.  Inside the BODY section
3.  External JavaScript .js file (separation of concern)

## 03.02.02. Inside the BODY section (code between the body tag)

- JavaScript programs/code/statements can be placed in the \`body\` section of an HTML page
- As blocking nature of \`script...../script\` tag ideally, scripts should be placed at the end of the \`body section\`, just before the \`closing /body tag\`, it will make your web pages load faster, since it prevents obstruction of initial page rendering
