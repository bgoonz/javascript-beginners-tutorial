5.  # Variables

Variables are one of the most fundamental concepts in JavaScript and other all programming languages.

## 05.01. Variable

- Variable is \`container to store/hold the data/information\`
- Variable is kind of data holder where we can store some value for programming or calculation purpose
- A JavaScript variable is simply a \`name of storage location (named containers/named storage)\` for data
- The \`assignment operator (=)\` is used to assign value to a variable, like this: \`var varName = value;\` or \`var firstName = 'JavaScript';\`
- Example: Variable declaration and assignment is just \`like Maths & Algebra\`: \`x = 10\`; and in JavaScript we write \`var x = 10;\`

## 05.05.01. Variable Scope

The scope of a variable is the region/coverage of your program in which it is defined and exist/available. JavaScript variables have two scopes:

1. Local Variables

---

- A JavaScript local variable is declared \`inside block or function\`, It is accessible within the \`function or block only\`
- A local variable will be \`visible only within a function\` where it is defined
- \`Function parameters\` are always local to that function
- \*\*Note\*\*: In function body, a \`local variable takes precedence\` over a global variable with the same name.

2. Gloabl Variables

---

- A variable declared outside the function/at root or declared with window object is known as global variable
- A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined and accessible anywhere in JavaScript code/program
