6.  # Data types

A variable in JavaScript can contain \`any type of data\`. Data types basically specify what \`kind of data\` can be stored and manipulated within variable in a program. In JavaScript different data types are available to hold different types of values/data. There are \`two main categories/types\` of data types in JavaScript:

1.  Primitive (Primary or Value) data type
2.  Non-primitive (Reference or Composite) data type

## 06.04. JavaScript has Dynamic Types

We have two types of programming languages:

1.  Static languages
    - Declare a variable, the type of the variable is set and it cannot be changed in the future
2.  Dynamic languages
    - Variable can change at run time (one variable can store different types of value as per requirement)

- A JavaScript variable can contain/hold any data, A variable at one moment can be a number and at another moment be a string, boolean
- It simply means that \`same variable can be used to hold different data types\`
- JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine
