4.  # Generating Output

- JavaScript does not have any \`display or built-in print\` functions
- Many times we may need to generate output from your JavaScript code like \`see the value of variable\`, or \`write a message to browser console\` to help you \`debug an issue\` in your running JavaScript code, and so on
- That is why you have to use the JavaScript output function to generating output \`(browser window or browser console dialog boxes, writing output into an HTML element, etc.)\`
- Using different output methods knowledge will help you while debugging or rewriting your code more conveniently

## Different ways to show output/display data

1.  Writing into an alert box with \`alert() or window.alert()\`
2.  Writing into browser console with \`console.log()\`
3.  Writing into the HTML / Browser Window with \`document.write()\`
4.  Write into an element of HTML / Inserting Output Inside an HTML Element with \`innerHTML\`

## 04.01.02. Writing Output to Browser Console: console.log()

- Programmers can easily outputs a message or writes data to the browser console using the \`console.log()\` method
- \`console.log()\` function is mainly/widely used for \`debugging code\` as it makes the JavaScript output print to console
- This is a simple, easy but very powerful method for generating detailed output
- Note: Use \`F12\` key on the keyboard to open the \`developer tools\` then click on the \`console tab\`
