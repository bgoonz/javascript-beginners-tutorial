7.  # Operators

\- We know/use many operators since our initial school days, they are things like addition +, multiplication \*, subtraction -, open close round bracket ( ) or square bracket \[ \]

- Operators are symbols/keywords that tell the JavaScript engine to \`perform some sort of actions\`
- JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands
- Operators used along with our variables and constants to create expressions to implement logic and algorithms

## JavaScript supports the following types of operators:

1.  Arithmetic Operators
2.  Assignment Operators
3.  Logical Operators
4.  Comparison (or Relational) Operators
5.  Conditional (or ternary) Operators
6.  Bitwise Operators
7.  Special Operators
8.  String Operators

## 07.02. Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations (just like mathematics) on numbers/the operands. JavaScript supports the following Arithmetic operators (List of Arithmetic operators):

| Operators | Description | Example / Result |  
| **+ | Addition** | 10 + 20 = 30 (Sum of num1 and num2) |  
| **- | Subtraction** | 20 - 10 = 10 (Difference of num1 and num2)|  
| **\* | Multiplication** | 10 \* 20 = 200 (Product of num1 and num2)|  
| **/ | Division** | 20 / 10 = 2 (Quotient of num1 and num2) |  
| **% | Modulus (Division Remainder)** | 20 % 10 = 0 (Remainder of num1 divided by num2)|  
| **++ | Increment** | var num1 = 100; num1++; Now num1 = 11 |  
| **-- | Decrement** | var num1 = 100; num1--; Now num1 = 9 |  
| **\*\* | Exponentiation (ES2016 / ES6)** | 2 \*\* 2 = 4 ; 2 \*\* 3 = 8 (Multiply num1 for num2 times) |
