# 08.01. Functions

1.  A function is basically a \`group of statements that perform specific tasks/operations\`
2.  Functions provide a way to \`create reusable code packages\` which are more portable and easier to debug
3.  Functions allow a programmer to \`divide a big program\` into a number of small and manageable functions
4.  It helps programmers in writing \`modular codes\`
5.  Function is a kind of reusable tool where we can write code/functionality to reuse whenever we want (Function allow the code to be called many times without repetition)
6.  Wrapping up / making smaller chunks of statements / reusable codes together for readability or separation of concern/proper organization is functions â€“ (Grouping of repetitive task)
7.  In other languages is might be called \`MODULES , SUB ROUTINES\`
8.  There are two steps to utilize function: 1. create/define function with \`function\` keyword 2. call/envoke function

## Here are some advantages of using functions:

- Code reusability - call a function several times
- Less coding - makes our program compact, no need to write lines of code each time
- Easier to maintain - changes done only at one location
- Easier to eliminate the errors - fixing errors becomes much easier

## 08.03. Different ways to define Function

- The syntax that we've used before to create functions is called \`function declaration\`.
- There is another syntax for creating a function that is called a \`function expression\`
- and \`Immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)\`

## 08.03.02 function expression

- Variables contain the expressions of a function
- Anonymous function expression
- Named function expression
