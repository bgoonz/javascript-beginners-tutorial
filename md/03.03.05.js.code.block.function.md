# 03.03. JavaScript Code structure

The syntax of JavaScript is the \`set of rules\` that define a correctly structured JavaScript program. Lets study some of the building blocks of JavaScript code:

1.  JavaScript Statements
2.  Whitespace and Line Breaks
3.  Semicolons
4.  Case Sensitivity
5.  JavaScript Code Blocks

## 03.03.05. JavaScript Code Blocks

- JavaScript commands/statements/code can be grouped together in code blocks, \`inside curly brackets {...}\`
- Grouped statements/lines form code blocks
- The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together like a single JavaScript command
- An often occurrence of a code block in JavaScript is a JavaScript \`function\`
