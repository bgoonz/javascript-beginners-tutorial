## 13.01. Understanding Events and Event Handlers

Events are happening/triggering all over, Event lets the developer know \`something has occurred/happened\`

Events occur when the page loads (Onload), when user interact with the web page (clicked a link or button / hover) (onlick), pressed key, moved the mouse pointer, mouse-clicked/hover (onmouseover), entered text into an input box or textarea (onchange,onblur, onfocus), submits a form (submit), page unloads (unload)

When an event occur, use a JavaScript \`event handler (or an event listener) to detect\` them and perform specific task - Event handlers name always begin with the word \`"on"\`, like onclick, onload, onblur, and so on.

To react to an event you \`listen\` for it and supply a \`callback function or event handler\` which will be called by the browser when the event occurs
