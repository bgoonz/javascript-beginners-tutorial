## 10.4. The Switch...Case Statement

- The switch...case statement is alternative to if...else if...else statement, both does almost the same thing
- This matches the \`case\` and the \`value of condition\` and if the case matches, the subsequent block is executed and if none of the case matches \`default block\` is executed
- The JavaScript switch statement is used to execute one code from multiple block of expressions
- Note\*\*: Use \`switch\` to specify many \`alternative blocks of code to be executed\`
