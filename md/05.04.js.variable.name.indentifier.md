5.  # Variables

Variables are one of the most fundamental concepts in JavaScript and other all programming languages.

## 05.01. Variable

- Variable is \`container to store/hold the data/information\`
- Variable is kind of data holder where we can store some value for programming or calculation purpose
- A JavaScript variable is simply a \`name of storage location (named containers/named storage)\` for data
- The \`assignment operator (=)\` is used to assign value to a variable, like this: \`var varName = value;\` or \`var firstName = 'JavaScript';\`
- Example: Variable declaration and assignment is just \`like Maths & Algebra\`: \`x = 10\`; and in JavaScript we write \`var x = 10;\`

## 05.04. Variable Naming Conventions (Identifiers)

All JavaScript variables must be \`identified\`/referred/defined/named with \`unique names\`, called as \`identifiers\`. The naming rules in JavaScript are not much different from any other programming language.

- There are some rules while declaring/naming a JavaScript variable (also known as \`identifiers\`)
- Identifiers can be \`short names/nick names\` (like name,age,num1,isDone,sum) or more descriptive names (firstName, totalDashboards, isSeniorCitizen)
- A variable name must \`start with a letter, underscore (\_), or dollar sign ($)\`
- A variable name \`cannot start with a number or special characters\`
- or naming the variables that contain multiple words, \`camelCase\` method is commonly used (camelCase is the default method for identifier naming)
