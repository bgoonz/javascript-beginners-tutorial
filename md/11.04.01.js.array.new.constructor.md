11. # Array

1.  An Array is special type of variable/object which \`consists of / stores multiple values\`
1.  Arrays are complex variables that allow us to store more than one value or a group of values under a single variable name
1.  Arrays are defined with \`square brackets \[ \]\` and with \`new\` keyword
1.  Array items are normally separated with \`commas ,\`
1.  Arrays are zero-indexed i.e. the first element of an array is at index/position 0
1.  Array is ordered collection, where we have a 0th, 1st, a 2nd, and so on elements
1.  Each value (an \`element\`) in an array has a \`numeric position\`, known as its \`index\`, \`starts from 0\`, so that the first array element is arr\[0\] not arr\[1\]

## Different ways to create/define an Array:

1.  By array literal
2.  By creating instance of Array directly (using new keyword)
3.  By using an Array constructor (using new keyword)

## 11.04. By using an Array constructor (using \`new\` keyword)

- Array instance can be created using the \`new\` keyword \`new Array() passing arguments\` in constructor so that we don't have to provide value explicitly
- var myArray = new Array(element0, element1, ..., elementN);
