## 14.01. DOM (Document Object Model)

- DOM represents the whole html document, DOM is a structure of HTML web page where all tags are defined in a structured/structural way
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is the model that describes how all elements in an HTML page (like input fields, images, paragraphs, headings etc.), are related to the topmost structure: the document itself
- DOM defines the logical structure of the documents and the way in which they can be accessed and manipulated
- DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard which defines a standard for accessing documents like programmers can build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content
- In DOM world always think in form/terms of \`Nodes\` (elements, its attributes, text etc.)

## 14.02. Node

As we learnt above, in DOM, all parts of the document (like elements, its attributes, text etc.) are organized in a hierarchical tree-like structure; similar to a real life family tree which consists of parents and children. In DOM terminology these individual parts of the document are known as \`nodes\`.

There are different types of nodes like: \`Elements, Attribute & Text Node\`.

      <ul id="list" --> Element & Attribute NODE
        <li>first item </li> --> text NODE
      </ul

      * Elements NODES not contains text

## 14.05. JavaScript DOM HTML Get Set Attributes

- An attribute in HTML \`provides extra information\` about the element, and it is applied within the start tag
- An HTML attribute contains two fields: \`name & value / key & value\`
- JavaScript provides several methods for adding, reading or removing an HTML element's attribute like \`setAttribute(), getAttribute(), removeAttribute()\`

## 14.05.03. Removing Attributes from Elements

- The \`removeAttribute()\` method is used to remove an attribute from the specified element
