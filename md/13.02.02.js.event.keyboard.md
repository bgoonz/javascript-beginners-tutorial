## 13.01. Understanding Events and Event Handlers

Events are happening/triggering all over, Event lets the developer know \`something has occurred/happened\`

Events occur when the page loads (Onload), when user interact with the web page (clicked a link or button / hover) (onlick), pressed key, moved the mouse pointer, mouse-clicked/hover (onmouseover), entered text into an input box or textarea (onchange,onblur, onfocus), submits a form (submit), page unloads (unload)

When an event occur, use a JavaScript \`event handler (or an event listener) to detect\` them and perform specific task - Event handlers name always begin with the word \`"on"\`, like onclick, onload, onblur, and so on.

To react to an event you \`listen\` for it and supply a \`callback function or event handler\` which will be called by the browser when the event occurs

## 13.02.02. Keyboard events

A keyboard event is fired up when the user press or release a key on the keyboard. Here're some of the important keyboard events and their event handler:

1.  **keydown / keyup** (\`onkeydown\` & \`onkeyup\` event handler)  
    Occurs when the user presses down a key and then releases the button/a key on the keyboard
2.  **keypress** (\`onkeypress\` event handler)  
    Occurs when the user presses down a key and then releases the button/a key on the keyboard- Occurs when the user presses down a key on the keyboard that has a character value associated with it  
    Keys like Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Esc, Arrow keys, etc. will not generate a keypress event, but will generate a keydown and keyup event
