6.  # Data types

A variable in JavaScript can contain \`any type of data\`. Data types basically specify what \`kind of data\` can be stored and manipulated within variable in a program. In JavaScript different data types are available to hold different types of values/data. There are \`two main categories/types\` of data types in JavaScript:

1.  Primitive (Primary or Value) data type
2.  Non-primitive (Reference or Composite) data type

## 06.02. Primitive (Primary or Value) data type

Primitive data types can \`hold only one value at a time\`. Primitives are \`compared by value\`. Two values are strictly equal if they have the same value.  
There are different types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:

| Data Type | Description |  
| **String** | represent textual data. e.g. "welcome" or 'to javascript' |  
| **Number** | represents numeric values e.g. 10, 100.29 |  
| **Boolean** | represents boolean value either false or true |  
| **Undefined** | represents undefined value (variabled declared but value not assiged) |  
| **Null** | represents null i.e. no value at all |
