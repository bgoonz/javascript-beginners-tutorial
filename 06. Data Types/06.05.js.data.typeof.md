6.  # Data types

A variable in JavaScript can contain \`any type of data\`. Data types basically specify what \`kind of data\` can be stored and manipulated within variable in a program. In JavaScript different data types are available to hold different types of values/data. There are \`two main categories/types\` of data types in JavaScript:

1.  Primitive (Primary or Value) data type
2.  Non-primitive (Reference or Composite) data type

## 06.05. The typeof Operator

- The typeof operator returns the \`type of the argument\`
- Itâ€™s useful to process values of different types differently or want to perform a quick data type check
- The typeof operator can be used to find out what \`type of data a variable\` or operand contains
- It can be used with or without parentheses \`(typeof(x)\` or \`typeof x)\`
